This week has been a whirlwind of meetings :imp: As much as I don't particularly enjoy that though, they have been important for planning our meaningful project. 

## Goals

#### Document some of my learnings better (e.g. write a topical blog post, or make a cheat sheet)

I have successfully written topical blog posts! :star2: And I hopefully have one or two more to come next week.

#### Finish gathering proposals for the meaningful project and decide on one!

Also done! :innocent: We have gathered proposals, written them up to give to Mark, and chosen one to take forwards. The others will be given to the other proteges as potential options for their projects. It was a lot of work, but well worth it.

## Tasks

#### Jon's TDD workshop

Jon went through his thought process when starting to tackle a problem using TDD. This was really useful to see, since it clearly showed how you're meant to use TD in a top-down manner to drive the design of your application. He also suggested avoiding coding any actual implementation for as long as possible; interfaces and dummy implementations are much easier to throw away if you decide you want to change something. Finally, he suggested using these dummies to drive your tests, rather than IO.

#### Project planning

I spent a lot of this week in meetings about our meaningful project. We met with everyone who had given us a proposal to talk about it and gather high-level requirements, and then wrote up a document summarising all of the proposals. We then had another meeting with Mark and Tom to decide on a project, and more meetings with the stakeholders of that project to start more detailed planning. I'm happy that we have made a decision and are moving forward now though (although next week will probably also be a lot of meetings!). I'm also excited about the project which we chose.

#### Kenneth's HTTP workshop

Kenneth took us through some basics on how http servers work, which was very interesting and useful.

#### Adding blog pages with Liquid templating

I spent some time adding an archives page to my blog, since I have started having trouble finding old posts. I also added tags to my posts, and made a page to organise posts by tag, and a special page for posts tagged "learnings" to make these much easier to find. I made these new pages using the Liquid templating language, which wasn't too difficult. I found how other people had done similar pages via a quick internet search, and then modified these to suit my needs.

## Takeaways

* Having a lot of meetings is annoying, but sometimes necessary.
* Lots of meetings means little time to code though :disappointed:
* Projects take a lot of planning.
* I still need to work on learning TDD.

## Next Week's Goals

* Document what I've learnt from doing ctfs.
* Do enough planning that we can start working on the group project.
* Do at least one more natas level.
