title: Week Three in Review
---

This week seemed quite short since I spent two days working from home (in order to more easily attend doctor's appointments :mask:), and I spent a lot of time working through Code School courses before the trial expired. I definitely learnt a **lot** thanks to that though.

## Goals

#### Improve typing speed

I feel like I've gotten a bit better at touch typing; I've noticed that I'm looking at the keys less as I type. I don't think my actual speed has improved much yet though, and I do still look at the keys sometimes, so this is something I will need to continue to work on.

#### Practice git and vim commands

I didn't get to this at all (four goals was probably too many!) so I will try to work on it next week instead.

#### Finally finish reading _New Programmer's Survival Manual_

Done! See below for notes on the book.

#### Get more confident with Javascript

I have definitely improved my Javascript. It is similar enough to Java that I've always been able to muddle my way through, but it was really good to finally learnt it properly. I went through the Code School introductory courses, best practices courses, and Node.js course. It was very useful to learn things from a Javascript perspective, since the way it deals with functions and objects in particular is very different from Java. I found Node also very interesting, since I haven't formally learnt about sockets or callbacks before.

## Tasks

#### Code School Javascript courses

I completed five courses on Code School: Javascript Road Trip parts 1-3, Javascript Best Practices, and Real-time Web with Node.js. I liked the way Code School ran the courses, with brief videos explaining concepts and then plenty of exercises to actually practice them. While I learn concepts well from lecture-style things like the videos, I found that I needed the exercises to learn the syntax properly. I found the videos a little slow-paced though, so I watched them on 2x speed which helped a lot! 

#### Elixr code wars exercise

I pair programmed with Elliot for this. I hadn't done any Elixr before, so it was very interesting to use a programming language with a completely different paradigm. I don't think I'm very good at Elixr yet, but I certainly learnt a lot from the experience. It was especially good to work on something with a far more experienced developer; I learnt a lot from observing his workflow and thought process.

#### Networking workshop

It's been a long time since I learnt networking fundamentals (10 years? Uni barely covered it so it must have been year 11 or 12), so this was a good, fast-paced refresher for me. I know that there's still a fair bit which wasn't covered in this, and which I've forgotten the specifics of though, so I should look into those things for my own reference in the coming weeks.

#### Payslips coding exercise (again again)

After a further code review with my mentors, we decided that I should work on adding dependency injection to my payslips exercise. While there's some other things which I could fix, at this point I'm not going to learn a lot from that, so we decided to focus on an area which I will learn from and ignore the rest. Since I will be out a lot next week, I'm going to look into it by myself for now, and ask them for help the week after if I need it.

#### Pair programming with Elliot

Elliot was working on changing how a Node application handles message events. This was really interesting and useful to watch (although I called it pair programming, in practice I was mostly watching while I got a feel for the application). As well as all the things (mentioned above) which come from seeing a more experienced developer at work, it was also a fantastic demonstration of all the Node things I'd learnt the day before.

#### _New Programmer's Survival Manual_ chapters 4 to 7 

Chapter 4 covered working with other people, who will likely have different personality types. You need to learn to work effectively with people with different perspectives. You need to be aware that influence is not always connected to the formal organisation chart; personal connections play a large role. Knowing who to get on side before pitching ideas, or who will know the person to ask about a topic, is very valuable. Finally, meetings should have a clear purpose and be constructive.  
Chapter 5 talked about different roles with the engineering department and the wider company. It suggested how to begin a conversation with people in various roles, and emphasised the value in getting to know people from a wide variety of backgrounds.  
Chapter 6 discussed project and product life cycles, and how your role changes depending on where your product is at. It also suggested taking time to consider your role from the company's perspective. Finally, it discussed some red-flags when it comes to business practices.  
Chapter 7 focused on self-improvement, how to keep a positive outlook and continue learning, and future career goals.  
I think that the main takeaways from this book are to focus on writing solid, maintainable code which improves the product rather than quick fixes. You should also make sure that you get recognised for your work, and work as best you can within your team and company. You should have both a deep understanding of and high skill at your job, as well as a wide breadth of knowledge of the company as a whole and the various roles within it. Effective team work is also important; be a positive influence within the team.  
On the final point the book raised about future career goals, I think that this is something I should keep in mind during the grad program. The program is my best chance at experiencing a wide variety of areas within the engineering department (although obviously in low-level roles), and thus learning which I love or hate. I really want to have as much variety as possible in my crew rotations, so that I can be exposed to as many areas as possible and hopefully get a feel for where I want to aim long-term.

#### Organise workshops and maintain calendar

I was on duty to organise workshops this week (we're rotating the responsibility around the team). I found this a very valuable experience, as it gave me greater exposure to others in the organisation. I think that we have prehaps more limited opportunities to meet others than we could, so needing to organise the workshops gave me a good avenue to meet more people in a range or roles.

## Takeaways

* Javascript handles things a bit differently from Java, but is definitely worth learning! Node also seems very useful.  
* It is good to be familiar with a range of programming paradigms.  
* Revise old knowledge and practice new.  
* Be a positive influence in your team.  
* Make an effort to meet people.

## Next Week's Goals

With three full days taken up with workshops next week, I think it's best to aim for smaller (and fewer!) goals.

* Use more hotkeys  
* Practice git and vim commands
