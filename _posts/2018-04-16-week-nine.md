title: Week Nine in Review
---

I spent a lot of time writing code etc this week :sunglasses: So although I didn't do many different tasks, I still got a lot done! It's nice to be able to spend a decent chunk of time coding.

## Goals

#### Do more of the Over The Wire exercises - and use the shell tricks I learnt in the zsh workshop :star2:

I did more of the capture-the-flag exercises; I finished Leviathan and got about a thrid of the way through Natas. I didn't do too well on using shell shortcuts though, not helped by the fact that Natas is web-based! I did learn a lot about basic website security though, which I think will be very good knowledge to have.

#### Use the design learnings I got out of the Game of Life kata

This goal I definiely achieved. The Game of Life and Tic Tac Toe katas are very similar, so it was quite easy to apply the design feedback I got from one to the other.

#### Document some of my learnings better (e.g. write a topical blog post, or make a cheat sheet)

I didn't do this at all :sob: So it's time to try again next week! In particular I think a CLI cheat-sheet would be useful.
