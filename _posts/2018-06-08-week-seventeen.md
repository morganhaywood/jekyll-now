This has been a very productive week. We got a lot of functionality added to the project, so it's nearly at our MVP goal now :grin:

## Goals

#### Get better at mobbing

I feel that we've improved greatly over the last two weeks. The sessions with Mark (see below) were particularly useful, but also I think that just having more time to figure out what works for us as a team (and individually get **any** mobbing experience) has made a big difference.

## Tasks

#### Mobbing

We've been mobbing on all the code (i.e. whenever we don't have meetings etc). As mentioned above we've made a lot of progress on the project, and our mobbing itself has improved a lot. We had a couple of hours with Mark while he was in town; we spent some time just discussing the mobbing process and how to make it more effective, and then some time with us working and him interjecting with suggestions. It was really useful to have someone with a lot of experience to help us improve our process, especially since none of us had really done any mobbing before.  
On Friday two of us were working remotely, so we tried out using Slack screen sharing for mobbing. It wasn't quite as good as mobbing in person, but it still worked surprisingly well. The main problems we came across were that the office wi-fi can't support the bandwidth (although it's completely fine on ethernet), and that there's a bug where remote people can't type `:` or `N` (which we got around by using the mac keyboard-viewer to type them instead). Overall I think that it's best to mob in person where possible, but remote mobbing is definitely a viable option if necessary.  
Next week we will need to start working on making what we've done actually deployable :sweat_smile: We did things a little out of order (normally you'd get the pipeline set up before coding things) since we have pretty limited experience with CI/CD.

#### Project architecture

We had some discussion with Matt and Dede about what the project architecture should be. We were pretty close with what we'd already done, which is nice. We have now been tasked with writing this up as a formal document, which is useful for a learning-the-process perspective but probably comes a bit late to be useful for the project itself :joy: If nothing else, I've certainly learnt a lot about the value of doing things in the right order and in a timely fashion :stuck_out_tongue:

#### Kanban board game

We spent half a day playing a board game designed to teach kanban concepts. It was pretty fun and I definitely learnt a lot about flow, the value of WIP limits, and why it's good to have team members who are specialising generalists. I think that the board game was a good way to teach these things, since it demonstrated then by forcing them to be ignored (showing what goes wrong) and you to try to get the system back on track. I certainly have a much deeper understanding after being able to safely and quickly mess with a system.

#### Story slicing workshop: Carpacci method

This was an exercise in writing stories for a project, such that they were as thin a slice as possible and gave value to the customer in each slice (and then working through them). This was a useful exercise, although I think that in the real world it will be a lot more difficult than in the exercise!

## Takeaways

* Mobbing takes time to get working, but can be very effective when you get it right
* Once again, doing things in order helps :joy:
* When using kanban, flow is key - but other things help with it
* Slice stories small!
* Unrelated: I apparently type a **lot** faster on my mechanical keyboard at home :sweat_smile:

## Next Week's Goals

* Get the project deployable, with CI/CD set up
