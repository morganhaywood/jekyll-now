This is a summary of the vim introduction given to my by the lovely Jonathan :blush: Let me make clear from the start, this is not a vim user's guide to vim. This is an oh-crap-some-command-just-dumped-me-into-vim-help! user's guide to vim. There's quite a difference. And if you're wondering, yes, that's happened to me _multiple_ times before.

First things first, your panic button: escape. If in doubt, hit escape until you're sure you're out of whatever mode you've got yourself into, then take a deep breath and start over. Unless otherwise stated, this guide assumes that you're starting from a nice clean new vim window (which, fyi, you might not have if you've been unexpectedly catapulted into it). Or that you've mashed esc until you have one.

Second key point: everything is case sensitive. Upper and lower case versions of commands tend to do _similar_ things, but they are **not** the same. Pay attention to case, or find yourself wondering why you're typing at the end of your file instead of the start.

Finally, I suggest playing around with the following commands in a text file you don't care about. It's much easier to understand how exactly everything behaves by actually _seeing_ it. The command `vim file.txt` will create and open a new file called _file.txt_ in the current directory (unless that file already exists, in which case it will just open it).

#### Saving and exiting

**`:w`** writes (saves) any changes you've made.

**`:q`** quits vim, if you have no unsaved changes. If you do have unsaved changes, it will give you nice warning message instead.

**`:q!`** quits vim, discarding any unsaved changes.

Most commands proceeded by a `:` can be chained (although you won't see any more in this guide), so `:wq` is a quick way to save and quit.

#### Adding text

**`i`** gets you into insert mode. This lets you type text like you normally would. Take care though: unless you move your cursor, you'll start typing _before_ the character under you cursor.

**`a`** appends, and is very similar to `i`. The difference is that while `i` inserts before the current character, `a` appends after the current character.

**`I`** starts you inserting at the start of the current line, and **`A`** starts you appending at the end of the current line.

#### Moving around

Your arrow keys should let you move your cursor around the document. If these don't work, try using **`h j k l`** instead (for left, down, up, and right respectively).

**`$`** takes you to the start of the current line, and **`^`** takes you to the end. If you're on a mac, you can alternatively use fn + left / right arrow.

**`gg`** goes to the start of the document. If you precede it with a number (e.g `8gg`) then you will go to that line.

**`G`** goes to the end of the document.

#### Copying and pasting

**`yy`** yanks (copies) the current line. If you hit a number first (e.g `3yy`), you can yank multiple lines starting from the current one.

**`p`** pastes after the current line, and **`P`** pastes before the current line.

**`dd`** cuts (or if it's easier to remember, deletes) the current line, and like `yy` can be proceeded by a number to cut multiple.

#### Making mistakes

**`u`** undoes the last action. Warning: everything you type between hitting `i` (or `a` etc) and hitting escape counts as one action. If you insert 5 paragraphs, escape and then undo, you will lose them all. Consider at minimum exiting insert mode occasionally (and preferably saving).

**`^r`** (control + r) to redo the last thing you undid.

#### Searching text

**`/`** will let you type text for which to search. Press enter to search for what you typed (e.g. `/hello` followed by enter will take you to the first instance of the word _hello_). **`n`** will move you to the next instance.

You can add some regex-style expressions for more sophisticated searching, although vim uses a largely different syntax from the more standard perl-style one. A quick search for _vim regex_ should point you in the right direction.

Beyond the above commands, there's some useful settings which might make your life easier (especially if you're editing code). These can be typed in (preceded by `:` and followed by enter) when you open a document, or added as-is to your `~/.vimrc` so that they run automatically every time you open something in vim.

**`set number`** shows line numbers.

**`syntax enable`** enables syntax highlighting.

**`set showmatch`** will highlight matching brackets.

**`set scrolloff=3`** will keep 3 lines visible above and below your cursor (if possible). Substitute other numbers for more or fewer.

```
set foldenable
set foldlevelstart=99
set foldmethod=indent
```
will let you fold blocks of code (nicely) with **`za`**. This acts as a toggle, so `za` will also unfold.

```
set autoindent
set expandtab
set smarttab
set shiftwidth=2
set tabstop=2
set softtabstop=2
 ```
will give you nicer, auto-indenting tabs.

There's a lot deeper you can go into vim, and **lot** more ways to make editing in it more efficient. But the above should be all you need to actually _use_ it at a basic level, and not have to start desperately web-searching if you're ever forced to :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
