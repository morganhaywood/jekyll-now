This is a summary of two of the books I've read, and what I thought of them :innocent: It's largely pulled from my weekly reviews, and will be updated as appropriate.

## _Apprentiship Patterns_

I found this book a very quick, interesting read and well worth the time. It posits that the first step on the long road to mastering the craft of software development is becoming an apprentice. 
It also advocates enjoying this stage, where you can focus on learning rather than other obligations. Finally, it tries to instill a commitment to developing good, life-long learning habits. 
I think that I should keep in mind the attitude promoted in this book.

## _New Programmer's Survival Manual_

Chapter one of this book focused on writing good code. 
It advocated paying attention to writing correct, clean, modular and readable code; writing tests, and testing early and often; and making use of frequent code reviews. 

Chapter 2 discussed the importance of choosing your language and platform to suit the task, and working idiomatically in them rather than trying to force them to be something they’re not. 
It also taked about choosing your tools carefully, and updating them as appropriate.

Chapter 3 discussed the need to find a mentor, and be aware of your personal image. It talked about performance reviews, why they’re important, and how to make them as pain-free as possbile. 
It also included suggestions for how to manage your stress levels and ergonomics.

Chapter 4 covered working with other people, who will likely have different personality types. You need to learn to work effectively with people with different perspectives. 
You need to be aware that influence is not always connected to the formal organisation chart; personal connections play a large role. 
Knowing who to get on side before pitching ideas, or who will know the person to ask about a topic, is very valuable. Finally, meetings should have a clear purpose and be constructive.

Chapter 5 talked about different roles with the engineering department and the wider company. 
It suggested how to begin a conversation with people in various roles, and emphasised the value in getting to know people from a wide variety of backgrounds.

Chapter 6 discussed project and product life cycles, and how your role changes depending on where your product is at. It also suggested taking time to consider your role from the company’s perspective. 
Finally, it discussed some red-flags when it comes to business practices.

Chapter 7 focused on self-improvement, how to keep a positive outlook and continue learning, and future career goals.
I think that the main takeaways from this book are to focus on writing solid, maintainable code which improves the product rather than quick fixes. 
You should also make sure that you get recognised for your work, and work as best you can within your team and company. 
You should have both a deep understanding of and high skill at your job, as well as a wide breadth of knowledge of the company as a whole and the various roles within it. 
Effective team work is also important; be a positive influence within the team.
 
I found this book useful, but a bit more dry than Apprentiship Patterns. I think that has a lot to do with it dealing with the wider corporate structure, rather than just programming though :joy: 
It’s still very useful advice though, and worth reading.

On the final point the book raised about future career goals, I think that this is something I should keep in mind during the grad program. 
The program is my best chance at experiencing a wide variety of areas within the engineering department (although obviously in low-level roles), and thus learning which I love or hate. 
I really want to have as much variety as possible in my crew rotations, so that I can be exposed to as many areas as possible and hopefully get a feel for where I want to aim long-term.
