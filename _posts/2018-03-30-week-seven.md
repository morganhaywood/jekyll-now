title: Week Seven in Review
---

This week was fairly short due to Easter, plus several meetings and workshops. I still got a resonable amount done though. I suspect next week will be similar since it will also be only four days.

## Goals

#### Remember how to write C

I am still very rusty at C. I did enough to remember how to get something working in it, but I feel like I'm writing C as if it was Java. I think a good next step would be to read a book on it to understand the idioms of the langauge.

#### Finish the blog posts in my backlog

I got one or two done, but added another, so this was a bit of a wash :persevere:

#### Get Docker working

This proved surprisingly easy :satisfied: The hardest parts were finding an image with gcc (turns out it's convenitenly called _gcc_ :sweat_smile:) and copying files into it (`docker ps` to find the container id and `docker cp <source_path> <container_id>:<destination_path>` to copy it turned out to work pretty well :yum:). 

#### Figure out my roadmap for the next few weeks with my mentors

I had a good chat with my mentors, and we decided that I should do the advanced katas. Depending on how I go with them I can then look at moving on to the projects in the next few weeks.
