## Goals

#### Work through my backlog (it's getting a bit out of hand... Too many things I want to do, too little time! :persevere:)  


#### Do some pair programming or other work with a teammate (it's been a while, although I disucss things and ask / answer questions often)


#### Do more work in lower-level languages


##### Do more work on the payslips coding exercise (it's been sitting in "doing" for far too long!)
