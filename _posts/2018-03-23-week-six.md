title: Week Five in Review

## Goals

#### Work through my backlog

My backlog is now _slightly_ smaller than it was at the start of the week, so I guess this one was somewhat successful? I definitely would have preferred to get through more cards though.

#### Do some pair programming or other work with a teammate

I did one kata with Mattias, so success! I have also arranged to do some with Pedro next week, and as a group we decied to assign random pairs to do one kata together each week, so I'll be doing that too.

#### Do more work in lower-level languages

I did some bash scripting which was a lot of fun :smile: I will hopefully be able to do more in the coming weeks.

##### Do more work on the payslips coding exercise

I finally got around to adding dependency injection (see below). I think I have done as much of this as I am going to, since while there's still a lot which could be improved, there's not much more that I can learn from it.
