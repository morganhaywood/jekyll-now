Our meaningful project is officially done! I'm really happy with how much we ended up getting done; I think we have a good app with enough functionality to be useful. And I have hope that it will continue to be used and developed. I've definitely learnt a lot from the project as well (which will be a separate post). I'm looking forward to starting crew rotations next week! :smile:

## Goals

#### Wrap up the project!

Done :yum: As above, I'm pleased with what we've accomplished.

## Tasks

#### Solo work

I ended up doing more solo work this week than in previous weeks. I made our error messages a lot more useful and worked on the search function.  While I like mobbing and pairing, it was a nice change of pace.  
The other thing I spent a lot of time on by myself was the pipeline. I updated our cloud formation templates to reflect the manual changes we made. I also did a lot more debugging; on Monday another crew made changes to the agents, which brought our pipeline down and took a while to diagnose. After all the time I've spent trying the fix the thing this week and last, I have quite a good understanding of the whole thing now though :joy: I really enjoyed working on it though, despite how frustrating the constant errors could be, and I learnt a lot.

#### Mobbing and pairing

We did spend some time mobbing this week (or pairing, since people were away at various times). I'm going to miss working with these guys.

#### Handover

We handed over our project to the team who is going to own it from now on. They've been working closely with us throughout the project, so it went quite smoothly. It's good to know that the project is going to live on.  
I don't think we went through things very logically or smoothly though. If I had to do this sort of handover again, I'd take to my team first about the order we were going to discuss things, and try to make it a bit more logical (e.g. via  a use-case, top-to-bottom, or program execution order). We just sort of jumped around, which I don't think worked very well.

## Takeaways

* It's nice to break up pairing/mobbing with some solo work occasionally.
* Pipelines and deployment can be difficult to debug, but I enjoy working with them.
* Having to fix something repeatedly is a good way to learn your way around it.
* It's useful to work with the team you'll be handing over to during the project.
* It's nice to see your project continue on.

* Settle into my new crew
