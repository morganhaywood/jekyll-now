## Goals

#### Finish the Game of Life kata, with good design.

I finished implementing the basic version of this (without any extension requirements). I think I did ok on the design front; not perfect, but an improvement on my inital payslip exercise design, which is all you can really hope for :sweat_smile: See below for more details.

#### Get something useful done despite the short week.

I didn't get as much done as I would have liked, but given that I had large chuncks of time taken up by the BBQ and interviews I think I did ok :grin:

## Tasks

#### BBQ and Molkky game

This was a very successful BBQ; well done to the organisers! :smiley: It was nice to chat with all the mentors, grads etc in a more relaxed environment, especially since there's a lot fo mentors I really don't know at all. The molkky game afterwards was also interesting and fun (although not what I was expecting!). Overall it was an enjoyable afternoon :blush:

#### Game of Life kata

I only showed this to one of my mentors (since the other was sick) but he was quite happy with what I'd done. He was also glad that I'd used a lot of what I'd learnt from the payslip exercise. Then of course I showed it to Jon and he had suggestions for changing most everything :joy: But I was expecting that and he was actually less harsh than I had prepared for :grinning: I don't expect to do things perfectly any time soon (and even then differences of opinion make it impossible to be "prefect" for everyone :laughing:) but it's good to get sterner feedback from time to time; that's how you improve :wink:

#### Interviewing interns

Having gone through this interview process when applying for internships myself, it was very interesting to be on the other side of table so to speak. It was also nice to spend a bit more time with collegues whom I don't interract with much on a day-to-day basis; we had a fair amount of time between some of the interviews, and it's good to get to know people a bit better :blush:

#### _Clean Code_ chapters 5 and 6

Chapter 5 discussed formatting. It emphasised readability and consistency, especially when working as part of a team (since the whole team needs to use the same standards). I think the most interesting point it made was that code should be organised like a newspaper article, with the broad overview at the top and the nitty-gritty details at the bottom and a logical flow of information in between.  
Chapter 6 talked about objects and data structures. I haven't really thought about this topic before, so it was quite intersting. The main arugment was that the two are opposites - objects expose functions which act on their data (but hide the data itself) while data structures expose their data but have no meaningful methods. This means that objects let you add new classes easily but make it difficult to add functions, and vice versa for data strucutes. Hybrids tend to have the worst of both worlds, so you should carefully and deliberately choose which you are going to use for each class.

## Takeaways

* Keep iterating on design - you will get better!
* Objects and data structures are different things with different uses
* Getting to know people is important
* Pay attention to the ordering of methods (the computer may not care, but humans do)
* It's good to get different perspectives on things

## Next Week's Goals

* Do more of the Over The Wire exercises - and use the shell tricks I learnt in the zsh workshop :star2:
* Use the design learnings I got out of the Game of Life kata
* Document some of my learnings better (e.g. write a topical blog post, or make a cheat sheet)
