## Goals

#### Finish the Game of Life kata, with good design.

I finished implementing the basic version of this (without any extension requirements). I think I did ok on the design front; not perfect, but an improvement on my inital payslip exercise design, which is all you can really hope for :sweat_smile: See below for more details.

#### Get something useful done despite the short week.

I didn't get as much done as I would have liked, but given that I had large chuncks of time taken up by the BBQ and interviews I think I did ok :grin:
