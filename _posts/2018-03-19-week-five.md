## Goals

####  Write at least one blog post in addition to my weekly one  

Done, twice over in fact :innocent: I wrote one on [public-key encryption]({{site.url}}{% post_url 2018-03-14-public-key-encryption %}) and one on [using git from the command line]({{site.url}}{% post_url 2018-03-16-git-commandline %}).

#### Practice git and vim commands

Also done :star2: I set up a test repo and had a play with all of the git commands I used to use reguarlly, and made notes as I went. This was a really good exercise to get myself back up to speed with things I haven't done in a while, or used to use a GUI for.  
As for vim, I used it both to make edits in my test repo, and to write my blog posts. I found that for the most part it's actually easier to use than the GitHub GUI for writing posts, since it has syntax highlighting. I'm definitely feeling a lot more comforatable with vim now.

####  Do more work in lower-level languages

I completed the badit levels (see below), and worked on the command line a lot with git and vim, but didn't really do anything else towards this goal. I think I will try to work on it more next week.
