This week was very short for me, since I was on leave Thursday and Friday. We did make some progress on the meaningful project though.

## Goals

#### Start writing some actual code for the project (even if it's just spikes)

We did only do spikes, but we have made good progress with proof-of-concept type things which we can show our customer (and thus get all-important feedback).

## Tasks

#### CI/CD workshop

This was an interesting workshop, mostly focusing on Build kite. I've used Gitlab CI before, which was a useful reference point, but it was good to understand how Build kite works in comparison.

#### Light on the hill and solution options

We spent a lot of time this week going through the light on the hill and solution options processes. We really should have done these in the two weeks we were planning the project, but we didn't really understand the whole procedure. It's still valuable to go back and do them now though, since much of the point of this project is to learn the process.

#### Demo to a customer

This was a very brief, non-technical demo. It was very good to get feedback though, and to show that we have something that will add value for the customer.

#### Data import and cleaning

I worked on importing the data from an excel spreadsheet into our database. I still need to iron out the fine details, but I did enough to demonstrate that it is possible and reasonably quick and easy using dummy data in the same format. I then started working on cleaning the real data, since it had a lot of inconsistencies, multiple values in a single cell, etc. which would be very difficult to handle programatically. I still have some work to do on this next week.

#### Mob programming

We did some mob programming on a spike to investigate parsing json in Go. I'm glad we did it, but all of us are terrible at the whole mob process :laughing: Most of the time the typist was doing the majority of deciding what to type as well, which is basically the opposite of what's meant to happen. Overall I can't say it worked well at all, but it's probably worth trying again with a little more discipline.

## Takeaways

* Doing the process in order helps :sweat_smile:
* We need to persevere! :laughing:

## Next Week's Goals
 
 * Get some real data into a database
 * Get that database accessible
